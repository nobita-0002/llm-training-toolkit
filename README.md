# LLM Training Toolkit

A comprehensive toolkit for learning about Large Language Model (LLM) training with hands-on experiments using Qwen and StarCoder models.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into multiple branches for different learning experiments:

### Branches
- **main**: Core project structure and documentation
- **qwen-integration**: Experiments with Qwen model training and fine-tuning
- **starcoder-integration**: Experiments with StarCoder model training and fine-tuning  
- **documentation**: Project documentation, guides, and learning materials

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nobita-0002/llm-training-toolkit.git
cd llm-training-toolkit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Goals

1. **Learn LLM Training Fundamentals**: Understand the basics of training large language models
2. **Experiment with Different Models**: Work with both Qwen and StarCoder architectures
3. **Practice Fine-tuning**: Learn how to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks
4. **Build Documentation**: Create comprehensive learning materials for others
