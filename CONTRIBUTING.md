# Contributing to LLM Training Toolkit

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the LLM Training Toolkit! This is an educational project focused on learning about LLM training, and we welcome contributions from learners at all levels.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/llm-training-toolkit.git
   cd llm-training-toolkit
   ```
3. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Branch Strategy

This project uses a multi-branch approach for different learning tracks:

### Main Branches
- **`main`**: Stable, production-ready code
- **`qwen-integration`**: Qwen model experiments
- **`starcoder-integration`**: StarCoder model experiments
- **`documentation`**: Documentation and guides

### Workflow
1. Always create feature branches from `main`
2. Work on specific features in appropriate branches
3. Submit pull requests to the target branch
4. Keep your branches updated with the base branch

## Making Changes

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Include type hints where possible

### Documentation
- Update relevant documentation when changing code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update README.md if adding new features

### Testing
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test across different Python versions if possible

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** for your changes
2. **Make your changes** with clear commit messages
3. **Update documentation** as needed
4. **Run tests** to ensure nothing is broken
5. **Submit a pull request** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference to any related issues
